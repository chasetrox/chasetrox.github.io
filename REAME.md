The entirety of the spec is correctly implemented. This assignment required 3
pages to be created, an index, bio and resume page with 5 CSS rules each.
Further, each page contains the information required by the spec and passes
the w3 HTML/CSS verification.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment; however, I used
StackOverflow and w3schools.com for help.

This assignment took me a total of 6 hours.
